# 🏠 House Price Prediction using XGBoost

This machine learning project predicts house prices in California using features such as median income, total rooms, population, and proximity to the ocean. It leverages the power of the **XGBoost Regressor** for accurate and efficient regression.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- 🔍 **Data preprocessing**: missing value handling, one-hot encoding (with `drop_first=True`)
- ⚙️ **Model used**: XGBoost Regressor (with default parameters)
- 📈 **Evaluation metrics**: R² Score and Mean Absolute Error
- 📊 **Plot included**: Visual comparison between actual and predicted prices
